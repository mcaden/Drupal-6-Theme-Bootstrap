A Drupal 6 Starter Theme using Bootstrap and FontAwesome
http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/

Install:
Add theme folder to your Drupal 'sites/all/themes/' directory. Rename folder to your theme name and change all references to "bootstrap" to your theme name.

Note:
This does NOT allow for Bootstrap's javascript functionality. Drupal 6 is forced into a version of jQuery too far back for it to work.
